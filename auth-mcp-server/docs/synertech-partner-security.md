# SynerTech Partner Security Framework

## Overview
SynerTech's vendor evaluation process ensures all partners handling FlexiPlatform data meet security requirements. This framework covers our supply chain for the CloudMerge integration platform.

## Vendor Classification
**Tier-A Critical**: Direct access to customer data via FlexiPlatform APIs (quarterly reviews)
**Tier-B Standard**: Limited integration with internal systems (annual reviews)  
**Tier-C Basic**: No system access, service-only relationships (triennial reviews)

## Assessment Process
All Tier-A vendors must complete the SynerScore evaluation using our proprietary assessment tool:
- SecurityCheck module (infrastructure, encryption, access controls)
- ComplianceVerify module (certifications, policies, training)
- RiskCalculator module (financial stability, operational resilience)
- IntegrationReview module (API security, data flows, monitoring)

## Required Documentation
- SOC 2 Type II report (within 12 months for Tier-A)
- Security questionnaire via VendorPortal system
- Business continuity plan with 4-hour RTO requirement
- Cyber insurance proof ($2M minimum for Tier-A, $1M for Tier-B)

## Ongoing Monitoring
Continuous surveillance via PartnerWatch platform:
- Monthly security posture scoring through ThreatScore feeds
- Quarterly business reviews with account management
- Annual on-site visits for Tier-A vendors
- Real-time breach notifications via AlertStream integration

## Contract Requirements
Standard clauses enforced through ContractManager system:
- Data protection addendum with encryption mandates
- Incident notification within 6 hours via EmergencyNotify
- Right to audit through third-party assessors
